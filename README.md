The fptaylor tool requires the fptaylor executable and the fpbench executable to be added in path.
You can build the fpbench executable on my FPBench branch right now [here](https://github.com/cccfire/FPBench).
Clone the repo and build using ```make distribute```

```npm install```

```node main.js 3000 fptaylor```

hopefully that works, otherwise, good luck (just like dm me or something)!
